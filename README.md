# Red-Black-BST-Python
Pyhton implementation of a left-leaning red-black binary search tree. It's a practical and maintainable implementation of the 2-3 search tree. The Red-Black BST, similarly to the 2-3 ST, is balanced meaning every path from the root to a null link has the same number of black links. Such property allows for **guaranteed logarithmic time complexity** `O(log N)` on all symbol table operations.
